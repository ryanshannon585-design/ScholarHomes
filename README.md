# Ryan Shannon, Final Year Project

As part of my fourth and final year of my Computing Course in Dublin CIty University I was tasked with creating an application that I believed there was a niche in the Market for. As a college student, I wanted to create an application to remedy an issue close to my heart that continues to be relevant to this day, the student accommodation crisis. This application utilises social media elements to allow fellow students to connect with like minded peers and cohabitate in accommodation to both save money and secure accommodation for the year. On the git repository I have uploaded all my documentation throughout the year, definitively proofing the niche in the market using accredited sources. 

## Running The Application 

You can run this application locally by;

- Navigating to the ScholarHomes application:
 cd scholar home project \ src \ ScholarHomes
- Execute the following to run the server:
 python3 manage.py runserver
